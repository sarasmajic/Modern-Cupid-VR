# Modern-Cupid-VR


## About the game
The Virtual Reality game "Modern Cupid" takes you into a city where you roleplay as Cupid, equipped with a bow and an infinite amount of arrows, your job is to spot people who are in need of love. By shooting them with your "love arrows" you change an angry and grumpy person to a loved one only when they're blowing kisses and their love bar is full. Your job can be done by walking, teleporting to multiple towers or using the controllers' joysticks. Your success (the amount of people loveshot) is noted and written in the sky.
